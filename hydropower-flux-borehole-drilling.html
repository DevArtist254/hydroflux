          <p class="sec-p">
            We construct boreholes that offer services for a very long period of
            time without requiring any service or major maintenance. The
            refurbishment service is meant to ensure that the borehole remains
            in good condition and may also be a way of restoring the previous
            status of the borehole.
          </p>
          <p class="sec-p">
            For example, there are those holes which when they are dug, will
            start reducing the initial amount of water that they used to
            produce, this means that they will need to be refurbished so as to
            restore their lost glory.

          <p class="sec-p">
            We have a wide variety of equipment that can be used in borehole
            equipping. We use the latest equipment that they use to drill water
            from holes. These machines are of the latest technology, and they
            are very efficient compared to the previous ones. Their efficiency
            ensures that the whole drilling process runs smoothly without any
            problems arising during the drilling.

          <h2 class="sec-heading">Borehole surveying</h2>
          <p class="sec-p">
            Surveying is an essential aspect of the whole procedure of drilling
            for our company which deals with borehole drilling in Kenya. This is
            because it helps to determine some of the impacts that the drilling
            will have on the nearby boreholes as well as those other features
            that are dependent on the same water. This surveying will also help
            to determine the long-term service of the water. The quality of the
            water will also be given by this analysis.
          </p>
          <p class="sec-p">
            Our technicians carry out these services and are well-trained. Their
            services are world-class, with easy accessibility allowing anyone to
            get it. They also make use of equipment that is of new technology
            which makes their results accurate and reliable.

        <h2 class="sec-heading">Aquifer testing</h2>
        <p class="sec-p">
          We carried out tests using the set standards of practice. This ensures
          that all the rules which need to be followed are observed and all the
          parameters which are used to do the testing are all approved by the
          board which deals with environmental matters.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-p">
          The testing is done to trace large deposits of water and find out the
          extent to which the water table has extended. This gives a rough idea
          of the amount of water that can be drilled.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sec-heading">Pump and control systems</h2>
        <p class="sec-p">
          Our services include all the services that deal with the installation,
          supplying as well, and management of the equipment. Many of those
          firms that offer borehole drilling services in Kenya have very
          high-quality pumps that will provide the best service.
