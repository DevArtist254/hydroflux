          After you have completed drilling a borehole, the next step is
          thinking about how you will draw water from it. You can decide to do
          it manually using a rope but this method only works when you do not
          need a lot of water. When you depend on the borehole water a lot, then
          investing in a borehole pump is the way to go.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-p">
          If you want to get value out of the borehole you have dug, then you
          must get the right pump for it. This is the only way you can draw
          water from the borehole with ease. Before you can consider the
          borehole pump prices in Kenya, it is best that you first know whether
          the pump is right for your needs.

        Investing in a bigger pump than you need is a waste of money in the long
        run. If you skimp on quality and get a cheap model, the lifetime value
        you get from the pump will not be worthwhile. Therefore before you get
        down to choosing the borehole pump here are some considerations to have
        in mind;

          <strong>Desire flow rate and pressure –</strong> how much flow rate
          and pressure you will need will be dependent on how you will be using
          the water from the borehole. Are you looking to fill a tank before the
          water can be distributed for use? Are you looking to use the water
          directly for irrigating your farm? What type of irrigation will you be
          doing? It is important that you have the main use of the borehole
          water in mind when considering the pressure and flow rate you need.
          Some applications require high pressure while others will require high
          flow rates.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-p">
          <strong>Pumping distance –</strong> this is really important
          consideration to have in mind. The water will start from deep in a
          borehole, pumped up vertically, moved through a certain horizontal
          length, and then maybe up vertically again to a water tank. If you are
          getting water from a deep borehole you will need to invest in a really
          powerful borehole pump. The more power you desire, the higher the
          borehole pump price in Kenya.

        You should also consider the elevation from the top of the borehole to
        where the water will end up. Also, what is the horizontal distance that
        the water needs to travel from the top of the borehole to where it is
        needed or before it starts the vertical elevation to the tank?
