          Our hydrogeological maps are formulated by gathering data. It, therefore,
          involves the detailed evaluation of the water-bearing levels of rocks and
          their capability for filtration. Moreover, the intrinsic ability of these
          rocks to either store or resist water is also assessed. The pressure,
          type, and quality of the underground water are noted, delving into the
          intensity of the water flow through pores or fractures.
        </p>
        <p class="pri-p">
          Our hydrogeological surveys are done to determine the underground water
          level. Hydrogeological surveying is conducted prior to drilling a borehole
          in order to ascertain the quality and quantity of water available at a
          particular location. It has been well established that underground water
          is a better source of drinking water than surface water.

      <h2 class="sec-heading">Types of Hydrogeological Survey</h2>
      <p class="sec-p">
        A small-scale survey (1:1,000,000-1:500,000) is done in areas that have
        never been investigated previously, to gather preliminary information of
        the hydrogeological condition. These comprise details regarding the
        ability of the rocks in the area to retain water and overall underground
        water quality. Medium-scale surveys (1:200,000-1:100,000) are more
        elaborate, and conducted to collate information for hydrogeological
        mapping. Water-bearing complexes are mapped and a specific study is
        conducted regarding the retentive capacity of the rocks in the region.
      </p>
      <p class="sec-p">
        Large-scale hydrogeological surveys (1:50,000 and greater) are primarily
        initiated in order to deal with precise issues at the stage of engineering
        and operational planning. Areas, where water collection can be done, are
        identified and underground water reserves are examined through this type
        of survey. Medium and large-scale surveys also require drilling
        procedures, evaluation of the composition of the underground water and its
        quantity along with a proper measure of its flow. Construction of wells
        and pumping tests may be performed to understand the hydrogeological
        condition thoroughly.
